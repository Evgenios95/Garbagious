# Garbagious
## Author: Evgenios Pampoukos

This is a second semester project that I **will keep working on** after my exams on the 1st of June. (migrated from enterprise account) I will also transform the code to kotlin, add a camera functionality, barcode reading ability etc.
The main goal of this project is to clearly understand what concurrency is and to use many different concepts that I have learnt in Java in the first semester.

More versions have been developed throughout this semester and can be seen in git history. It is basically an app which works in horizontal and landscape mode and handles garbage and garbage placements.

It can run with android studio if you just import a new project and run an emulator.
